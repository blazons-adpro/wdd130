          <h2>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>
          <p>
            Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the
            Salmon river. The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the
            River of No Return by the people living near it because of the
            number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the
            rugged beauty of the river that they never left.
          </p>
          <p>
            Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and
            bear and bighorn sheep are also commonly sighted. The river corridor
            is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower over the
            sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain
            when needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon
            is one of the longest undammed rivers in the United States. As a
            free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the
            early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There
            are good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to
            swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.

          <h2>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h2>
          <p>
            Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most
            desolate land anywhere, the Green river flows towards the mighty
            Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert
            scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile
            trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green
            River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic
            formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and
            great whitewater opportunities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days
          </p>
          <p>
            Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark. This
            designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that the
            canyon tells.

              Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?
            </dt>
            <dd>
              Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have
              found however that children over the age of 8 seem to enjoy it
              more overall (And parents especially enjoy it more if their
              children are all over 8). A common concern we get from parents is
              that their children will be bored stuck on a boat for hours at a
              time. Surprisingly we deal with very few bored children of any
              age. The areas we are rafting through are some of the most
              beautiful in the world, and you never know what you might see
              around any corner. Not to mention the rapids which keep things
              very interesting. Each boat also comes equipped with a guide. It
              has been proven that river guides are unable to go for very long
              at all without telling stories...some of which are even true!

              Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim! Can I
              still come?
            </dt>
            <dd>
              As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed
              element of risk. To help ensure your safety, our guides are all
              certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with at least 3
              years of rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns
              and injuries that occur on land. Everyone on commercial rafting
              trips wears coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation
              device (PFD). Many non swimmers go on rafting trips and have a
              great time. Your guide will give you an in depth and engaging
              safety talk before your trip begins explaining what you should
              prepare for and do in the event that you fall out of the raft.
            </dd>
            <dt>What is included in the trip?</dt>
            <dd>
              We will provide all necessary camping equipment. This includes a
              sleeping bag, foam pad, waterproof duffle bag, small waterproof
              day bag, tent and a cot, eating utensils and camping chair. We
              provided water and lemonade during the day. Coffee, tea and hot
              chocolate are provided during the morning and evening hours. You
              may bring beer, liquor and soft drinks (in reasonable amounts, 2
              cans per day). You may purchase these items either the night
              before the trip, or on your way to the put-in. 3 meals per day,
              plus snacks

          <h2>Highlights from the past season</h2>
          <p>
            What an incredible season we have had. We celebrated our 50th year
            of running trips down the Grand Canyon. This year we ran 36 trips
            down the Grand Canyon introducing over 800 people to one of our
            favorite places on earth. We trained 4 new guides and welcomed them
            to our family. The season started off with some chilly weather in
            the early season, but our guests braved the cold and loved every
            minute of their trip (show pictures). Later the temperatures soared
            reaching highs of 120 F in the Grand canyon and 95 on the Salmon. We
            didn't have any trouble getting people in the water at those
            temperatures.
          </p>
          <h2>Encounters in the wild!</h2>
          <p>
            Our trips are all run in some of the most remote areas of the United
            States. We share these areas with lots of critters both large and
            small. Here are some tips on what to do if you should find yourself
            face to face with one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scorpions: There are hundreds of varieties of scorpions, most of
            them being harmless. There are, however, a handful of them that can
            be dangerous and even potentially lethal. Scorpions can be found in
            almost every ecosystem and are very adaptable to their environment.
            The scorpion that calls Phantom Ranch in the Grand Canyon home is
            the Bark Scorpion, the most venomous in the United States. Do not
            worry though, the bark scorpions are only lethal to their prey and
            luckily humans are not on that list!
          </p>
          <p>
            They spend the day hiding and crawl out at night to hunt. They will
            eat crickets, moths, spiders and other insects. Many compare their
            sting to an intense bee sting. Relief can be found with ice, aspirin
            and time.
          </p>
          <p>
            When in the canyon, pay attention to where you are walking at night.
            Always wear your shoes or sandals. Always have a light with you to
            see where you are going. Never try to capture a scorpion and if you
            get stung, see your guide immediately.
